# **HASE 3 PROJECT ON Tanzania WATER WELLS**

Access to clean and reliable water is a fundamental need, yet many communities in Tanzania face challenges due to malfunctioning or poorly maintained water pumps. 
The Tanzania Water Services dataset provides valuable information about water points across the country, including their location, management, and operational status. 
By leveraging data science and machine learning, this project aims to build predictive models that can classify the functionality of water pumps, supporting better maintenance planning and resource allocation for improved water service delivery.
