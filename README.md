# **HASE 3 PROJECT ON Tanzania WATER WELLS**

Access to clean and reliable water is a fundamental need, yet many communities in Tanzania face challenges due to malfunctioning or poorly maintained water pumps. 
The Tanzania Water Services dataset provides valuable information about water points across the country, including their location, management, and operational status. 
By leveraging data science and machine learning, this project aims to build predictive models that can classify the functionality of water pumps, supporting better maintenance planning and resource allocation for improved water service delivery.

# **Ojectives**
1. Develop and evaluate machine learning models capable of predicting the operational status of water pumps — whether they are functional, non-functional, or require repair.

2. Apply an iterative modeling approach, starting with a simple baseline model (Logistic Regression) to establish initial performance.

3. Refine and improve the baseline model through hyperparameter tuning to enhance prediction accuracy and generalization.

4. Build a more complex model (Random Forest Classifier) to capture non-linear relationships and improve performance on the classification task.

5. Compare model results based on performance metrics and interpretability to determine the most effective and practical solution.

6. Support data-driven decision-making in Tanzania’s water infrastructure management by providing insights into factors influencing pump functionality.
